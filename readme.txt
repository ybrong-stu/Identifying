The code is run with MATLAB  at Windows. The Matconvnet  toolbox  is required, which can be downloaded from: https://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/.  Once the Matconvnet toobox is set up, download all the code and data in a same file and run 'demoForAgeEstimation.m'  for quick start.  

Note: The primary focus of this study revolves around exploring explanation methods for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) specifically tailored for regression tasks.  The method could potentially function as an explanatory approach for CNNs in segmentation tasks and classification tasks as well. Run 'demoForODSegmentation.m'  and 'demoForClassification' for quick start.
